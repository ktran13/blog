The United States Digital Service (USDS) was created [under the Obama administration after the healthcare.gov disaster](https://www.fastcompany.com/3046756/obama-and-his-geeks) because the US government wanted and needed __to create a tech pipeline of talent to transform the way government uses and delivers technology.__ They created a tour-of-duty model for tech folks to join government on 2-4 year term-limited positions and use their tech skills to improve government services. You can see the USDS reports to Congress and the organization's amazing impact over the last two years [here](https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/) and [here](https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2017/07/).

I’m honored to have this opportunity to contribute my tech skills to the government after living in DC and being an engineer in the federal government consulting space for 2.5 years.

Some people might be asking — what? __Why would you want to join this administration?__ I thought about joining for the USDS for some time. Even though the election results gave me pause, I read this article about the Defense Digital Service (DDS) team [here](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/meet-nerds-coding-way-afghanistan-war/) then met and spoke with many former and current USDS members to give me perspective.

I decided to join the USDS because I want to use my tech skills for the benefit of the American people. The impact I have will outlast *any administration*. I specifically chose the [Department of Defense](https://www.dds.mil/) to work on tech projects directly affecting our national security, military service members, and their families.

Today marks the end of my eighth week at USDS ([It's been two months](https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/meet-the-team-november-8d12fe30db4c)!). This work isn’t easy or trendy in the tech sense. But after the 2016 election, __how better to have an impact than to join the government?__ If you’re interested in joining, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Furthermore, I am launching my personal blog site with this first post. After leaving my job at Deloitte Digital, I traveled around Japan, the Pacific Southwest, and Southeast Asia. __I want to share my lessons learned, reflections, and tips about backpacking for 7 weeks in 7 countries.__

This was my final itinerary -
- *Japan* - Tokyo, Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Okayama, Hakone
- *Pacific Southwest* - Las Vegas, Zion National Park, Page/Flagstaff, AZ & Grand Canyon
- *Singapore*
- *Indonesia* - Bali
- *Thailand* - Chiang Mai, Phuket
- *Cambodia* - Siem Reap
- *Philippines* - Coron Island/Palawan, Cebu City

Some people might have called my itinerary crazy, but it was one of the best experiences I’ve had. I learned so much about how food, fashion, weather, religion, war, poverty, tourism, western ideals all influence the people and cultures of the countries I visited. I also developed a deep appreciation for the natural beauty of the United States of America. This trip pushed me out of my comfort zone as I traveled alone on some legs of my itinerary.
